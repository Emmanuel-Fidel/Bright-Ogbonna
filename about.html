He was commissioned to supervise two hundred and ten (210) election observers during the 2007 election in Ogun state under aegis of UNDP. <br><br> The report from election observers of that year and the advocacy campaign that followed forced the government of President Musa Yarâ€™dua to sign into law the 2010 electoral act.
