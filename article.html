    ADVENTURERS IN POWER: THE TRAVAIL OF WORKERS AND THEIR RIGHT <br>
    <br>

By Comrade Bright Ogbonna
Wednesday August 8,2018
Preface of Thought! <br>
<br>

 The greatest asset in the hands of workers should be there unity and the ability to forge a common front for their collective struggle. Their voice of agitations is to be amplified by the leadership of their Unions who galvanizes them toward a collective direction of the movement. <br>
 <br> 

Historical precedents, has constantly reaffirmed that union’s leadership, has always assumed the position of cog to the wheel of the advancement of workers’ rights and welfare. Some of these leaders are often adventurers who has nothing to offer but finds themselves within the corridors of power rather than, use it to the advantage of workers, they use it to place workers in the belly of vultures. The lack of will power, vision and a progressive ideology are factors responsible for their poor leadership traits. Our case in ISON BPO is not different; rather it has assumed a more heinous nature. <br>
<br>

In order words, in addition to corruption, the single most innovating obstacle to assertively achieve workers welfare, has being the dominance of this unenterprising, greedy, and consumptionist oriented elements within the ruling class who happens to determine and influence management policies. <br>
<br>

Political unionist, sees union as a patronage venture, they tend to patronize members in order to further exploit them using hegemonic instruments that purges workers of their values, rights and freedom. They patronize workers with words like ’your name is on the list of those to be sacked’, ‘the economy is bad’ etc. They pretend to be helping, without their victims knowing that they are actually the cause of their problems because they assume a pretentious position to both the leadership of the union and to members. These adventurers, assumes the position of comprador and you see workers won by this, being unreasonably loyal that they tint into fallacy, hypocrisy or they support blatantly falsehood. As workers, we must conscientize ourselves to knowing when we are being fooled. <br>
<br>

Like we all know, ‘We were first humans before taking up this jobs’. These adventurers always tap into the political rhetorical mindset of workers to gain political relevance. They sell those dummies to Nigerian workers and because of the propaganda these characters plays out, using hegemonic catalyst like ‘there are no jobs out there; ‘workers are left to make choices of these propagandic dummies which often sees them making choices that further places them in chains. <br>
<br>

Ultimately, the recruitment of a visionary and strategic thinking leadership group, with great imagination and committed sense of unity will be the surest antidote for the poor workers condition. It should be obvious, that in the final analysis, it will be the responsibility of the ‘’Wretched of the Earth’’, the down trodden, those who really feels the pangs of the indignity of poverty and deprivation to recruit leaders who will best give them a good life. Workers should create a federation of the oppressed, that will midwife a pool of leaders fascinated by ideology, they should be weary of untested siniqual without demonstrable leadership capacity, self seeking pest whose only quest is the continuous amassing of wealth, little minds in high places, which have no penchant for the fine art of humanity. <br>
<br>

The emergence of all manner of hustlers with transparent criminal tendencies, disguised as piety, engendered by successive kleptocratic and visionless political leadership, has promoted charlatanism beyond imagination. <br>
<br>

The battle to secure a safe work place, will begin when workers thoroughly interrogate the character of those who want to lead them and for recruitment into leadership position, they build a better purifying mechanism that can keep out the ‘Bloody Dregs’ <br>
<br>

Above all else, in time when hope has eluded us, in a time when faith is turning into chance and not possibilities, when the alternatives for our sufferings are reduced into chains and turbulences, the only instrument left is; ‘SOCIAL REVOLUTION’
