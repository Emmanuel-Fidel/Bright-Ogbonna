Fellow comrades, we can’t continue to do things the same way and expect a different result. We need to inject leaders with fresh ideas into the leadership cadre of our union if we must make progress. <br>
<br>

My name is Comrade BRIGHT OGBONNA contesting for the post of Deputy President of National Union of Postal and Telecommunication Employees (NUPTE). I have come to rekindle HOPE, spark REACTIONS in all of you and set the motion for guaranteed PROGRESS for our great Union. 


To make this happen, the following are my creed or manifesto that will guide our actions.</p>  <br>
<br>

<p class="emma">1. ORGANIZING:</p> <p style="font-size: large;"> The telecom sector with the enormous potentials has remained untapped. As your Deputy President coming from that sector we are going to prioritize organizing. We understand the terrain very well having led organizing of spectranet, fairmoney and Union bank call centers which are domicile in Ison in the past. For NIPOST we will intensify the consent form process introduced by the President Comrade Buba by empowering state council chairpersons to carryout that task through actively driving welfare issues of members at their stations, this will naturally win members to us.</p> <br>
<br>  

 <p class="emma"> 2. UNION FUND:</p> <p style="font-size: large;"> It is no longer fashionable to depend on Check Off Dues(COD) for union funds globally. Unions are inventing new funding mechanism by investing in business within their trade and one they have the comparative advantage. Business ventures like courier services, logistic or dispatch business and other financial investment are innovative ways of driving funds without necessarily over burdening the members whose salary has been eroded by the harsh economic policies of government with COD.</p> <br>
 <br>

  <p class="emma"> 3. TRAINING:</p> <p style="font-size: large;">We will as a matter urgency develop a strategic training methodology patterned along a modern organizing model to reinvigorate true spirit of unionism among rank and file. </p> <br>
  <br>

 <p class="emma"> 4. INSTITUTIONALIZING LABOR STANDARDS:</p><p style="font-size: large;"> We will strengthen the fundamental principles of protecting, defending and promoting the decent work agenda within post and telecom world.</p><br>
 <br>

 <p class="emma"> 5. DIGITALIZATION:</p> <p style="font-size: large;"> The place of social media and the digital space cannot be overemphasize. We will launch NUPTE into the digital through regular interactions on social media apps like twitter, facebook, instagram, website etc. </p> <br>
 <br>

    <p class="emma"> 6. WELFARE and WORKERS RIGHT:</p> <p style="font-size: large;"> We will continue to drive members  welfare and that of secretariat staffs whilst also defending their rights and advancing socioeconomic justice. </p><br>
    <br>

<p class="emma"> 7. COLLABORATION:</p> <p style="font-size: large;"> All the above cannot be achieved by an individual. We will collaborate with the entire NAC in line with the union’s constitutional provisions, to making sure that all is put into proper perspective for onward execution. </p><br>
